	Added a new event: SlideNavigationControllerWillOpen

August/2017
	This repo is a public fork on https://github.com/RosterHQ/iOS-Slide-Menu because I couldn't get it to animate a new view controller into position when the menu was not open.
Also, I've trashed the .git folder so that this code will actually push to github. If you need to make changes, pull down https://github.com/RosterHQ/iOS-Slide-Menu, make the changes, push them up, and copy this back into the project. Clumsy, I know.
